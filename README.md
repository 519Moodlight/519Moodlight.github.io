All contents can be re-write in the README file.

Contents from Canvas:
- A project showcase (brief project overview with cool photos/videos, probably on your main page).
- Project instructions, in enough detail that someone else could re-create your project (components used, assembly details, block diagrams, description of your RP2040 dev environment, links to your code, etc).
- Narrative overview of your project's development, and how it evolved from proposal to demo day (showing photos/screenshots/gifs at each stage).
- Any significant issues you had to troubleshoot, and how you solved them or adapted your plans (including diagrams, REPL sessions, scope traces, etc.)
- Reflections on your design and components/parts you selected, including advantages/disadvantages, whether you would recommend a similar design to future teams, and other design approaches/components you might try next time.
- A bit more detail about some feature or accomplishment you found particularly satisfying.
- An explanation of the PIO part of your code, including a diagram of the overal logic, as well as an introduction to the RP2040 PIO module and what makes it a unique asset for a microcontroller.
- Team overview (ideally with brief photos/bios, up to you) with links to your individual github accounts or personal pages.
