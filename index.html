    <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
    <p>In project 3-1 and 3-2 we implemented pathtraced rendering on glass, mirror and microfacet material.
        However, we didn't have support for various textures. In this final project, we want to add texture support 
        to make the rendering more appealing and interesting.</p >
    
    <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
   <div align="left">
    <h4 align="middle">What we plan to deliver?</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to be able to map various textures including cloths and simple 2D textures to objects.</p >
    <p>We want to keep the rendering fast, reusable, and able to cope with different textures realistically.
        We think that the basic logic of implementing texture mapping is the same as the one introduced in class.
        We could build on that and try to find suitable reflection and refraction for varied and complicated
        textures such as clothes, which involve more complex reflection and refraction techniques.

    <h4 align="middle">What we hope to deliver?</h2>
    <p>We would hope to achieve a rabbit wearing realistic cloth (including pleats and yarn), or make the rabbit look furry. To accomplish this
